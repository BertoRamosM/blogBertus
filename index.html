    <div class="article"><p>Here I am going to record my odyssey in learning programming.<br></p>

        <p> It will serve as a reminder to my future self,
        to be able to preserve memories of all the things worth remembering from this journey.<br>
        The journey started a while ago, and at the time of writing these first lines, 
        we have already encountered some pirates and a few krakens.<br></p>



        <p>Just a few days ago, I finished the most complex project so far: the calculator.<br>
        As the final project of the Foundations section of the Odin Project,
         I was able to showcase many skills I have learned so far.
          Though they are still few, they make me very proud.<br>
        At the beginning of Foundations, I started by refreshing the concepts of HTML and CSS. 
        They weren't particularly complex.<br> </p>


        <p>Until I reached Flexbox. There, honestly, 
        I was stuck for a week and a half until it finally clicked in my head. 
        That's when I realized all the amazing things that could be done with that tool. 
        What joy! What a dopamine rush! I finally "mastered" a complex and very useful tool...
         But of course, that was nothing compared to what was to come.<br>
        Then I began with JavaScript.<br></p>

        <p>At first, it was also familiar territory. 
            Variables, conditionals, functions, arrays, loops... 
            I thought I knew them fairly well, but... NO!<br>
        It was much more complex than I had thought.<br>

        I knew the theory: "yes, of course, a function is a piece of code that performs 
        an action and can be reused anywhere in the code." HA! How clever I thought I was...<br>
        I will also try to use this blog to showcase some of the skills I am learning, 
        such as creating different layouts and functionalities on each page. 
        I think it's a good introduction. Tomorrow, I will publish another article discussing some 
        of my early projects. Cheers!</p>
