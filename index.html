    <div class="article"><p>Here I am going to record my odyssey in learning programming.</p>
        <p>It will serve as a reminder to my future self, to be able to preserve memories of all the things worth remembering from this journey.</p>
        <p>The journey started a while ago, and at the time of writing these first lines, we have already encountered some pirates and a few krakens.</p>
        <p>Just a few days ago, I finished the most complex project so far: the calculator.</p>
        <p>As the final project of the Foundations section of the Odin Project, I was able to showcase many skills I have learned so far. Though they are still few, they make me very proud.</p>
        <p>At the beginning of Foundations, I started by refreshing the concepts of HTML and CSS. They weren't particularly complex.</p>
        <p>Until I reached Flexbox. There, honestly, I was stuck for a week and a half until it finally clicked in my head. That's when I realized all the amazing things that could be done with that tool. What joy! What a dopamine rush! I finally "mastered" a complex and very useful tool... But of course, that was nothing compared to what was to come.</p>
        <p>Then I began with JavaScript.</p>
        <p>At first, it was also familiar territory. Variables, conditionals, functions, arrays, loops... I thought I knew them fairly well, but... NO!</p>
        <p>It was much more complex than I had thought.</p>
        <p>I knew the theory: "yes, of course, a function is a piece of code that performs an action and can be reused anywhere in the code." HA! How clever I thought I was...</p>
        <p>I will also try to use this blog to showcase some of the skills I am learning, such as creating different layouts and functionalities on each page. I think it's a good introduction. Tomorrow, I will publish another article discussing some of my early projects. Cheers!</p>
